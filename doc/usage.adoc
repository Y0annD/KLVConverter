== How does the library works

The first step is to create a logger, because logging is important to debug or retrieve information if needed.

[source,C#]
----
using ILoggerFactory factory = LoggerFactory.Create(builder => builder.AddConsole());
Logger = factory.CreateLogger("KLVConverter");
----

The second thing to do is to open the file (or stream) to read as stream.

[source,C#]
----
using (FileStream fs = new(@filePath, FileMode.Open)) {
    using BinaryReader binReader = new(fs);
}
----

Important things is to open the file in **Open** mode. There is not any reason to write in this file. (for the moment).

Then the library use __BinaryReader__ to be able to read large files.


The second thing to do is to add the __Manager__, that do all work of file reading.
