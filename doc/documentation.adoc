== Introduction

The aim of this library was initial to read content of __STANAG 4601__ data in a video stream.

The library will allow to be extended for specific usages but it's not encouraged to use this one in production as it was not tested with real data.

The library is quite easy to use and was design to be efficient for reading files. It might work on network stream, but was not tested yet.

It was design to avoid usage of any specif library outside of native __C#__ library.
